### Prelog
During this week, a lot things have done.   

First of all, I have learned about how to write the first part of IELTS writing. 
Although it's review, but it still help a lot as I have almost forget everything I have learned last time.

To improve my English skill while having fun, I have installed Arknights (US version) and restart my jounery against Reunion Movement
with Rhodes Island. Trivaling with Cynthia， I tried to develop a new mod for Tetra Project, with the help of algorithm, I have understood
the 'List' and 'Foreach' function easily. However, I still dont understand why Alive not add such a variable based each save data.

I tried installed a pitch which aiming on append a Ray tracing step after the render pipeline of the original game render of Final Fantacy XIV online.
I think FFXIV is really a good game. lol. After reshader is installed, the graphic has a sharp inctease while my GPU is almost could fry chips.

Along three contests about take part in the ICPC contest, our team have reached 4th rank at each of them. Its dramatic and amazing. with my teammates,
I think our team may have a chance take part in that world-wide competition.

As Im playing a role of translater and supporter in my team, I still need improve my English skill. Not only I need that for passing IELTS test,
but also I want learn more language to broaden my horizon while knowledges of other culture is very interesting to explore.

### Epilog
I will do more practice about algorithm as I need more knowledge to understand deeplearning algorithm and other artificial inteligence algorithms.

In next week, I'll learn things about Android develop. After knowing the process of a program's whole life, connect with the knowledge of
Windows programing, I think I can have a better understanding of that.

Really thanks Boss Li and Boss Ji, they gave me a lot help. I believe it's not lot, it's our effort made that.
